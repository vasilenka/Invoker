        Over the years, Etsy’s design system went through many incarnations. The way we organized to do the work also changed, and in 2016 we created our first dedicated Design Systems team. Up until then, it had been built and maintained by a group of designers and engineers who did it on top of their regular product work. Improvements were being made, but slowly. As demand increased, it became clear we needed a full-time team to keep pace.

    </h1>

    <p class="Body--normal">
        We had a grand vision that by enabling a team of designers, engineers, and product managers to focus on the continued maintenance, improvement, and adoption of our system, the rest of the product org could go back to concentrating on building customer experiences. Anyone could still contribute to the work, but the heavy lifting was now the responsibility of the Design Systems team.
